Thanks ‚Äî that gives us a clear picture:

### üîç Current Situation

* ‚úÖ `nvidia-smi` works ‚Üí Your **GPU drivers are installed correctly**.
* ‚ùå `nvcc` gives no output ‚Üí The **CUDA toolkit (compiler)** is **not installed** or not in your `PATH`.

---

### ‚úÖ Next Step: Install CUDA Toolkit (Compiler)

You need `nvcc` to compile OpenCV with CUDA. Since you're on Ubuntu 24.04.2 and have a **Tesla T4 (compute capability 7.5)**, here's how to install CUDA properly:

---

### üîß Step-by-Step: Install CUDA Toolkit on Ubuntu 24.04.2

#### 1. **Clean up any old CUDA versions (optional)**

```bash
sudo apt --purge remove '*cublas*' '*cufft*' '*curand*' '*cusolver*' '*cusparse*' '*npp*' '*nvjpeg*' 'cuda*' 'nsight*' 
sudo apt autoremove
```

#### 2. **Download the CUDA Toolkit Installer**

Go to the official [CUDA Toolkit download page](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads).

* Select:

  * **OS:** Linux
  * **Architecture:** x86\_64
  * **Distribution:** Ubuntu
  * **Version:** 24.04
  * **Installer Type:** `deb (local)` is easiest

It will give you commands like:

```bash
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/x86_64/cuda-ubuntu2404.pin
sudo mv cuda-ubuntu2404.pin /etc/apt/preferences.d/cuda-repository-pin-600
sudo apt-key adv --fetch-keys https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/x86_64/3bf863cc.pub
sudo add-apt-repository "deb https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/repos/ubuntu2404/x86_64/ /"
sudo apt update
sudo apt install -y cuda
```

Let me know if you want me to get the latest working commands from the site for you.

---

#### 3. **Add CUDA to your PATH**

After installation, add these lines to your shell config (`~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`):

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/cuda/bin:$PATH
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/cuda/lib64:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
```

Then reload:

```bash
source ~/.bashrc  # or source ~/.zshrc
```

Test:

```bash
nvcc --version
```

---

Once `nvcc` works, you're ready to go back to building OpenCV with CUDA.

Would you like help automating this setup with a script or checking for cuDNN as well?
